Among individuals who do not take supplement A, the risk (probability) of being infected by the seasonal flu is 0.2 during the flu season. What is the corresponding odds value? ( Hint: Odds is defined as P(A)/[1-P(A)] ).
  1/6
  1/5
  1/4 -- correct
  1/3

A scientific paper found that taking supplement A will reduce the odds of being infected by the seasonal flu by half. Which of the following statement is true?
  The odds ratio between taking supplement A and without taking supplement A is 1/2.  -- correct
  The odds ratio between taking supplement A and not taking supplement A is 2.
  The risk of getting the flu after taking supplement A is half of that without taking supplement A.
  The risk of getting the flu after taking supplement A is twice of that without taking supplement A.

Why are the characteristics of estimates derived from observational health studies unknown?
  We do not have full control or knowledge of the sampling process.
  We do not know whether there are unmeasured confounding factors. 
  We do not know whether there are any systematic measurement errors in the observed data.
  All of the above. -- correct
  
Why do we need to have better understanding of the characteristics of estimates derived from observational health studies?
  Biased estimates will lead to misrepresented statistical significance. 
  Unmeasured confounding will lead to spurious association findings.
  Systematic measurement errors will contribute to poor reproducibility of findings.
  All of the above.  -- correct

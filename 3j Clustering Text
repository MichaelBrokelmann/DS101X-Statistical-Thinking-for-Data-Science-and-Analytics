Bag of words models are a fundamental part of computational text modeling. Indicate whether each of the statements about a bag of words model is true or false:
The order of words in a document does not matter.
  True correct
  False

Different documents can produce the same bag of words representation.
  True correct
  False

Grammar is kept in a bag of words model.
  True
  False correct

Bag of words models are used because they are more computationally tractable than document representations with word/location pairs.
  True correct
  False

Scaling problems can occur when one document is much longer than another.
  True
  False correct

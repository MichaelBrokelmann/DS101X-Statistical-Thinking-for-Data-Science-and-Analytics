Which penalty is heavier when Y is close to your guess?
  Squared error
  Absolute error correct

What about when Y is far from your guess?
  Squared error correct
  Absolute error 
  
You are likely familiar with estimators that use these metrics, such as the mean and the median. The mean value, M, of a set of n numbers, Y1, Y2, … Yn, is M = (Y1 + … + Yn)/n. It is also the number that minimizes the squared error (Y1 - M)*(Y1 - M) + … + (Yn - M)*(Yn - M).
Compute the mean of -1, 0, 1, 2, 23.

The median, m, of those same numbers is the value where half of the values are above and half are below. It is also the value that minimizes the absolute error, |Y1 - m| + … + |Yn - m|.
Compute the median of -1, 0, 1, 2, 23.
  1

Compute the squared error and absolute errors for both the median and the mean.
Squared error for median:
  490

Absolute error for median:
  26

Squared error for mean:
  410

Absolute error for mean:
  36
  
Squared error(M) = 6*6 + 5*5 + 4*4 + 3*3 + 18*18 = 410
Absolute error(M) = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 18 = 36
Squared error(m) = 2*2 + 1*1 + 0 + 1*1 + 22*22 = 490
Absolute error(m) = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 22 = 26

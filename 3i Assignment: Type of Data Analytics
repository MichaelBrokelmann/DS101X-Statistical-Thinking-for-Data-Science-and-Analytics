A bank would like to split loans into two groups—those that are likely to default and those that are unlikely—using a set of attributes like user FICO scores, age, and default history. Which type of data analytics is needed?
  Descriptive Analytics
  Predictive Analytics -- correct
  Prescriptive Analytics
  None of the above

The same company would like to use a model to determine a FICO score cutoff for issuing loans. What type of model would they use?
  Descriptive Analytics
  Predictive Analytics
  Prescriptive Analytics -- correct
  None of the above

Finally, the bank would like to study its customer base and group customers according to shared attributes. This is an example of which type of analytics?
  Descriptive Analytics -- correct
  Predictive Analytics
  Prescriptive Analytics
  None of the above

Some methods do not fit neatly into one category or another. Trees give predictions based on a series of binary splits of the attribute space. For example, a probability of default could be predicted through a series of if-then statements: if {FICO
700} then {prob default = .02}; else if {FICO
700} then {prob default = .10}. This is an example of:
  Descriptive Analytics and Predictive Analytics -- correct
  Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics
  Prescriptive Analytics and Descriptive Analytics
  A combination of all three
